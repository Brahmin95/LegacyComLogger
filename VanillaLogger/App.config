    THE DEFINITIVE FIX: The <assemblyBinding> section has been completely removed.
    This section contained the binding redirect that was incorrectly forcing the use
    of an incompatible v8.x library.

    By removing it, we allow the .NET runtime to load the correct, compatible v1.x
    DLLs that are present in the bin folder. This is the core principle of the
    "NLog v4 Ecosystem" approach.
