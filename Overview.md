# Overview: The Modern Logging Framework

## 1. The Problem: A Black Box in Production

Our legacy application ecosystem, composed of both modern .NET services and critical VB6 applications, has historically been a "black box" in production. When issues arise in our Citrix environment, our support teams and developers struggle with:
-   **Lack of Insight:** Inconsistent, unstructured text-based logs make it nearly impossible to search for specific events or correlate actions across different parts of the system.
-   **Diagnosing User-Specific Issues:** It's incredibly difficult to isolate the actions of a single user in our multi-user Citrix environment.
-   **Reactive Troubleshooting:** We often only learn about problems after a user reports a crash, with little to no diagnostic information about what led to the failure.
