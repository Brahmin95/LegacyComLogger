      THE DEFINITIVE FIX: This <probing> element tells the .NET runtime where to look for assemblies.
      The `privatePath` is a semicolon-separated list of subdirectories relative to the application's base.
      By setting it to ".", we are explicitly telling the runtime: "Make sure you search the application's
      root directory for any DLLs." This solves the discovery problem for NLog's extensions and any
      other dynamically loaded dependencies, making the <extensions> tag in nlog.config work reliably.
